# Project Milestone 0: Planning

The first part of the SDLC is planning. Planning mainly consists of two parts: feasibility and requirements analysis. 

For the purposes of this course, we will assume that feasibility has already been conducted and has determined that this project can move forward. Your team has the funding, the technology, the business environment, and political support to build this software solution. 

The second part of planning is requirements analysis. Read the project overview document appropriately titled 'Overview.md' to help you identify the requirements of the system. As part of the requirements analysis, your team will create User Stories and some preliminary tasks. 

Review the slides on User Stories from Module 4. Recall that User Stories are composed of a description and acceptance criteria. For an example, see [this User Story](https://github.com/cs5500-neu/monorepo-template-main/milestone/1). In addition, from these User Stories, you need to develop specific, technical tasks. See how [this example](https://github.com/cs5500-neu/monorepo-template-main/issues/11) of a task and how it is associated with a User Story. 

As an aside, note that Github does not have this notion of a "User Story". Instead, you can create a "Milestone", which is basically the same thing. Moreover, to create a task on Github, you will have to create an "Issue". 

There is no required limit to the number of User Stories that you have to create. However, you should have at least one User Story that covers the requirement of Authentication and Authorization.

Note that User Stories are living, breathing documents. They are subject to change during the whole process of the SDLC, especially during design and implementation. That means that you need to update and maintain these User Stories as the project progresses. As the project progresses, anticipate creating more and more tasks that need to be associated with a User Story.  

## Deliverables

On Canvas, submit the Github links to your project board and to each User Story (aka Milestone in Github-speak). Each User Story must have some preliminary tasks associated with it.
