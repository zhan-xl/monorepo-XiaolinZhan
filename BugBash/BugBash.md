# Bug Bash Instructions

A [Bug Bash](https://blog.testproject.io/2021/04/05/the-ultimate-guide-to-organizing-a-bug-bash/) is a software team event that seeks to identify bugs in a product. All stakeholders of a software product team participate by trying to break their product. 
During a Bug Bash, issues are identified which are then used by the development team to help improve, fix, or even add features to their product. 
Usually these issues are incorporated into a Sprint. 

Our final assignment of the course is to conduct a Bug Bash for each team's project, culminating in an hour-long Sprint that will produce a version 1.x of the product. In other words, your team should expect to complete all phases of the SDLC in a fairly short time. Think of it as a mini Hackathon. 

## Timeline

Hour 1: Bug Bash
* Teams are paired together and exchange links to their respective GitHub Repo and URL to web service
* Each team will try to break the other's web service such as entering invalid data, simulating an edge case, or simply playing around with the tool 
* In addition to identifying bugs, each team can also suggest improvements; for example, critiquing the design of the web app or ReST API.
* For any bug or improvement, each team will fill out an Issue on the other team's GitHub Issue's page.  


Hour 2: Sprint
* Based on the issues identified during the Bug Bash, each team will now decide which issues should be addressed for version 1.x
* Each team does not have to address all the issues. Rather, the team has to decide what issues can be reasonably completed in one hour.
* This part of the exercise will force you to complete all the steps of the SDLC within the hour. So move fairly quickly.
* Deploy your version v1.x 
* Create a tag for v1.x
* Generate release notes for v1.x on GitHub


Hour 3: Feedback
* Instructor will check and grade each team's version v1.x  


# Grading

Total Points: 10 

Point Breakdown
* 5: New version behaves as expected and resolves issues that were completed during the Sprint
* 3: New version deployed to cloud
* 1: Tag created
* 1: Release notes created
