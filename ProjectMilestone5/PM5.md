# Project Milestone 5: Maintainance/Operations

In the final phase of the SDLC, we need to maintain the software and manage operations. Now that your app is deployed, the team
needs to setup the infrastructure to support making improvements, fixing any bugs, or releasing any new features.
In other words, your team needs to setup the feedback loop that allows your users to provide feedback. In a typical software project, users can submit feedback via email, 
a public-facing webpage, or comments section that is included in the public-facing documentation. 

Your team will create a demo video of how to use your app. Your team will also create a template to help users file any issues on your app. Finally, 
your team will prepare a Bug Bash file containing instructions and examples; this file will be used by other teams to try to use and break your app during the Bug Bash.

# Deliverables

* Create a five-minute demo illustrating how a user would use your app. 
  * Post the video on YouTube
  * Include the URL to your video in your README.md
* Create an Issue template in Github; see Resources section above on how to do this
  * Instead of filling out a blank form, users can raise an issue using a template
* Create a markdown file named `BugBash.md` and save it in the root of your repo. That file should have the following:
  * URL to your app; this should point to your website or Swagger docs page. If you don't have either, then this should be the baseurl to your ReST API's.
  * Examples of how to use the app (e.g. how to call the API using curl or screenshots of your webpage)
  * Link to Github Issues page 
    


**On Canvas, submit the GitHub link to your backend repo (i.e. opp-api). If your has chosen to build a separate UI, also include the link to `opp-ui`. Only one team member should submit it on behalf of the team.**
